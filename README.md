# PyTorch-Convolution-Neural-Network
This notebook follows my workings and understanding of Convolutional Neural Network's with PyTorch applied to the Computer Vision using the MNIST dataset.

The notebook includes my notes from a year ago with my understanding of each step. I will revise this soon to show my increased
understanding after completing Andrew Ng's courses on Coursera.
